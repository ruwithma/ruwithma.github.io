# My Experience

So, my experience as I was starting to learn cybersecurity is not an exact linear path that I have used. Even now, I'm still in the process of learning ethical hacking, and itâ€™s not the easiest thing to do. It might depend on what field you are planning to work in, but my particular interest is in **ethical hacking** and **bug bounty hunting**. So let me share with you what my journey is looking like and what resources and techniques I use in order to go forward in my journey.

I hope this blog post will help you XD

I'm a university student and I'm following a cybersecurity course at the university. Even though the uni gives a ton of good knowledge, the program Iâ€™m following mainly contains a lot of **real lab practicals**, where I get the chance to mess with the servers, networks, and stuff. It hasn't happened yet, but I'm really looking forward to it.

## Should You Stick With Your University Curriculum?

I think this has a clear answer: **NO**.

Thereâ€™s a lot more out there thatâ€™s important and waiting to be tapped by you. So, what I think isâ€”as you get lectures and other help from the uni, you should **maximize your learning** and take full advantage of the things given by the uni.

Also, when you have time (which youâ€™ll have plenty of), **use it to learn other things** like taking a course, learning something new, trying to build something, and more. These will need much more effort because you wonâ€™t get any study materials or lectures from the uni, but there are plenty of YouTube videos you can watch.

Even learning a new language when you have free time is great. Knowing another language can make you a heck of a lot cooler. ðŸ˜Ž

## How Do I Learn?

So, there are some cool websites and courses I use to learn, and Iâ€™ll share them with you and how to use them:

### CS50: Introduction to Python

The first one is **CS50â€™s Introduction to Python**, which is a really good course, and I'm currently in the process of completing it. Itâ€™s conducted by a guy called **David J. Malan**, and after each lecture, you get to do one problem set, which I think is really useful.

And I think for cybersecurity, having practice in Python or another scripting language can be **pretty crucial**.

This is a long course and it will take some time, but I got to know from some people in the industry that itâ€™s a **very good course**.

Youâ€™ll have to access the course and its materials through **edX**, and they will show you that to get the certification, you have to pay a big amount of money. But once you complete the course, **you will receive an official certificate from Harvard itself**â€”and itâ€™s totally free.

Another course in the CS50 arsenalâ€”and what I think is the **core course**â€”is **CS50's Introduction to Computer Science**. I havenâ€™t started it yet, but once I finish the Python course, Iâ€™ll give it a try. Itâ€™s like a basic CS course, but I think itâ€™s the **best course in the CS50 lineup**.

### PortSwigger Web Security Academy

This website has a **lot**. The most important thing is that this course was created by the developers of **Burp Suite**. This learning path has a lot of important stuff about **practical penetration testing**.

Theyâ€™ve got labs, so you can try what youâ€™ve learned practically. This will help you a lot, especially if your interests are in the **pen tester** or **bug bounty hunter** area.

Even I started going through this course recently and I find it useful. But make sureâ€”if you donâ€™t understand any term or slang usedâ€”**always Google it and do external research and study about it**.

### YouTube

I donâ€™t think YouTube needs much of an explanation. If you know what you're looking for, **you can find it on YouTube**.

What Iâ€™m talking about here are things like **tutorials, courses, explanation videos, and even lectures**â€”these can be super helpful.

Letâ€™s say you donâ€™t understand what **APIs** are. You can go to YouTube and there are countless resources you can find. Find something that you like and that helps you learn, and **stick to it**. Donâ€™t change videos every 5 minutesâ€”stick to one video. If you canâ€™t focus, take a break and come back.

There are plenty of good creators on YouTube who share cool stuff to learn. You just need to find people who match your learning style.

There are more resources I use, and Iâ€™m looking forward to writing about everything in the future.

I hope this helps you ðŸ˜Š

**Thank youâ€”until next time!** ðŸ‘‹
