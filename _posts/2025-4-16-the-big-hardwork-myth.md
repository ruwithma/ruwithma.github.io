# The big myth about hardwork and hustle culture

So this is my first post, and if you are wondering if that first post was AI generated and also I have added a note at the end of that post. So I hope you will learn something out of this blog.

## What has become the standard about work?

We all see people like David Goggins and other people like him influence us and what comes to our mind is that in order to win or actually become something in life you have to always do the thing, you always have to be disciplined and work like a robot.

And I know that most of the people think like this and they try to be disciplined all the time, work all the time, wake up at 4 am and workout right after it, and fill the whole day with tasks and complete them like robots no matter how hard the tasks are.

## How do people try to implement this work ethic?

This approach can work but it will only work in the short term. For example, let's say that suddenly you watch an Andrew Tate video and decide that you have to make this daily schedule and you have to stick with it. And the next day you wake up to execute your perfectly planned schedule and yes you will succeed at that day and even the next day but it is a fact that you will eventually experience burnout.

And then a thought will strike in your mind and you will think that you are not made for this and you will suddenly stop doing everything and go to your normal life and even worse than that because you're left with even less self-respect.

This method is destined to fail you and I know most of the people have tried this approach and failed.

I don't know about the scientific reason for this, but I'm pretty sure this is what happens.

## What is the right way to work?

First thing is you're not a computer program or a robot to execute a predetermined set of tasks. I think humans are born to be creative and work in flexible ways.

### The Do Something Principle

So what I follow is this "do something principle". Let's take one thing first. Let's say you want to improve in Python or any other language instead of going through a 6-hour course in one day what you do is do what you naturally are willing to do. It can be working on Python for 5 mins or you might even feel not to do anything and that is very common. In these moments what you have to do is do something.
It can be a little thing like write 5 lines of Python and then you stop and do whatever you want.

And later comes the next day and in that day the probability of you feeling to learn Python is high and maybe you are motivated and you will work on it for 1 hour. Great and stop when you feel like. Then the next day you might again feel like to not do it and then again you stick to the do something principle and let's say you spend just 5 mins learning Python.

By doing this you register to your brain that you are engaging in this activity consistently and that momentum will start to grow.

Some days you will feel motivated and you will do a lot of work, and other days you will just do something. But you keep that consistency and the more you do it the easier the task becomes to perform daily, and also you can make the best out of those days that you are motivated.

You can apply this to anything in your life. It can be for working out, for reading, for learning a new language, anything that requires to work consistently over a long period of time.

So that is it for today and I hope you guys learned something.

I don't have science to back this up but this is what works for me and I'll make sure to give an update if it stops working.
