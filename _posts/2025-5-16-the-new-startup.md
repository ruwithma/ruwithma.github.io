# Introducing ReadRizz (Our new startup)

I was unable to post in a long time because I was both bored and working on something new — an app that my friend Zenith and I had the idea to build.

Talking about how I got the idea, I remember we went on a trip to Nuwara Eliya and we stayed there for like 5 days. On the last day, we were sitting together and talking about some app ideas. I started talking about how I don’t have time to read books, and I told him that I used an app (I think I can’t mention its name) that I really enjoyed, where I could listen to audio summaries and stuff.

After that, I told him that making an app where people can join as a community, listen to audio summaries, read them, and make their own notes and thoughts — and share with others — would be a great idea. Then we started talking about all the pros and cons of making that app. We also discussed the name. We didn’t come up with the name **ReadRizz** right away, but we had a name and then decided to change it to **ReadRizz**, which we thought was way better and more relatable.

After we came home from the trip, about a week later we started to work on the app. Talking about Zenith — he’s a technical guy. He started on the project and on the first day we talked about the UI design. We made a design in Figma, and then Zenith started coding the app by himself. After 2–3 days, he came up with a basic version of the app — and I was amazed. After that, Zenith worked on all the technical stuff, and I have to say, if he wasn’t there, I wouldn’t have been able to build it on my own.

During the process, we changed a lot of things — like how things work, what technologies we use, what methods we follow, and how things look. Now, we've come to a build that we think is ready for testing — and it looks really, really cool. Since we’re doing this as a startup, we also have to handle marketing and posting all by ourselves, so that’s a bit of extra work. We started our LinkedIn profile and we’ve got something going on there.

## What does the app do? (Simply)

**📚 High-Quality Book Summaries**  
Each summary is carefully written to deliver deep insights in a simple, clear format — no fluff, just real value. Whether you're reading for learning, inspiration, or productivity, our content keeps you focused on what matters most.

**🎧 Conversational Audio Summaries**  
Our audio isn’t robotic or rushed. It’s conversational, relaxed, and easy to follow — like you're having a meaningful chat with the book itself. Ideal for listening on the go.

**🧠 Progress Tracking (Read & Listen)**  
Track your reading and listening progress effortlessly. Whether you're halfway through an audiobook summary or revisiting a key point, your place is always saved.

**📁 Seamless User Interface**  
We keep it smooth, minimal, and distraction-free. No complicated menus or overwhelming options — just a clean experience designed around _you_.

**📤 Request a Book**  
Can’t find a book you’re looking for? Let us know. We're constantly adding new titles, and your requests help shape our growing library.

**📅 New Books Added Daily**  
Stay updated with fresh summaries added every single day. There's always something new to explore and learn.

**💡 Built with the User in Mind**  
We don’t build what _we_ want — we build what _you_ need. Every feature exists to give you a better reading and listening experience.

Also, we modified our player a lot so you can have a better listening experience.

## What features we wish to add in the future

There’s this idea in my mind to add a feature where users can read something, make their own notes, and post them. Then, other people can read those notes, comment on them, and have discussions.

This will be a major feature, so we have to discuss it thoroughly. Also, I really need to know if this feature is something that users actually want — because there’s no point in making something that users don’t really need.

So that’s it for this blog. I’ll talk about the technical stuff in the next blog and maybe showcase the UI — but I have to first showcase it on LinkedIn.

Goodbye!
